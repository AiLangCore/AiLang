# UI Specification (Placeholder)

Status: Draft placeholder for AiVectra.

Scope for this stub:
- establish file location for future UI contracts
- define no runtime semantics
- introduce no integration requirements

Non-goals in this placeholder:
- rendering model
- event model
- widget/layout system
- host adapter contracts

This file exists to reserve the normative spec path for future work.
